          <h5>PROBLEM</h5>
          <h3>Stanford employees currently struggle to find other employees to carpool with. </h3>
          <p>
            Employees hope to carpool to save money, time, and the environment. However, the process of finding and joining a Stanford Rideshare carpool is tedious and time-consuming, preventing many people from actually carpooling.
      </p>
          <h5>SOLUTION</h5>
          <h3>We designed Journie, an app that helps employees join carpools by providing personalized recommendations.
</h3>
          <p>
            Users can also view their upcoming rides and stay updated about rides that are currently happening.

          <p>Let‚Äôs rewind back to the beginning.</p>
          <h5>USER RESEARCH</h5>
          <h3>Empathizing with users</h3>
          <p>
            In order to understand how we could improve Stanford Rideshare, we each interviewed 2 Stanford employees about their rideshare experiences, needs, and frustrations. Our <b>8 interviewees</b> included carpool coordinators, riders, and an employee who was unsuccessful in finding a carpool.
      </p>
          <p>
            We created an affinity map and journey maps to synthesize our findings and identify pain points.
      </p>

          <img src={JourneyMap} style={{ width: "100%", height: "auto" }} />

          <h3>Key Insights</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Employees <b>struggle to find carpools</b> that work for their schedule and location.</li>
            <li>People need <b>flexibility</b> when scheduling carpools.</li>
            <li>Even if a user finds a carpool that fits their needs, officially <b>joining is a hassle</b>. </li>
            <li>Carpools use <b>inefficient methods of communicating</b> and coordinating schedules. </li>
          </ol>
        </div>
      </div>

      <h5>IDEATION</h5>
      <h3>Defining the idea üß†</h3>
      <p>
        After analyzing these user insights and pain points, we asked ourselves this question:
      </p>
      <div className="emphasized-text">How might we help Stanford employees find carpools that fit their schedules and preferences?</div>
      <p>
        After brainstorming, we decided to design an <b>app</b> for Stanford Rideshare that accomplishes the following:
      </p>

      <div class="box-container">
        <div class="box"><div>Enables Stanford employees to <b>join carpools quickly</b>
        </div></div>
        <div class="box"><div>Clearly <b>allows for flexibility</b> to suit people‚Äôs schedules
</div></div>
        <div class="box"><div>Makes carpool information and <b>expectations transparent</b>
        </div></div>
        <div class="box"><div><b>Simplifies communication</b> between carpool members
</div></div>
      </div>
      <p>We aimed to help more potential members join carpools, so they can enjoy their commute and get precious time back.</p>
      <div className="small-text">Some ideas we nixed: an in-person meetup (too difficult to prototype with Stanford employees), an email list (didn‚Äôt want to cross into the Stanford Rideshare administrators‚Äô territory), and a dark horse hitchhiking app (for danger reasons).</div>
      {/* <h5>BLUEPRINT</h5>
      <h3>Mapping the service</h3>
      <p>
        The app would be part of a larger service that involves the customer, the product, and the employees. We made a service blueprint to visualize the entire service‚Äôs process.

          <h5>COMPARATIVE USABILITY TESTING</h5>
          <h3>Learning from other platforms</h3>
          <p>
            My partner and I tested existing products on 4 people to learn from their designs before we started on ours.

      <h5>PROTOTYPING</h5>
      <h3>Exploring different directions and converging on one</h3>
      <p>
        We created paper prototypes based on our idea and tested them on 3 people to decide which concept was best for users.
      </p>
      <p>Users felt that Prototype #3‚Äôs flow was the most intuitive and that Prototype #1‚Äôs upcoming ride calendar was very helpful. We decided to move forward with <b>a combination of the two concepts.</b></p>
      <div className="medium-overflow demo-box">
        <div>
          <img src={Prototype1} style={{ width: '85%' }} />

      <h3>The user's path üö∂‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</h3>
      <p>
        We made a user flow diagram to map how the user would navigate the selected app concept.
      </p>
      <img src={Flow} />

      {/* <h5></h5>
      <h3>Wireframes</h3>
      <p>
        We then wireframed a concept that combined two prototypes. Users of the app input their work hours and locations, receive a list of compatible carpools, and choose which one(s) to join and put in their schedule. They can also receive live information about carpools that are happening.
      </p>
      <p>
        I wireframed all of the following screens except for the Live Location one.
      </p>
      <div className="medium-overflow">

          <h5>USABILITY TESTING</h5>
          <h3>Getting feedback and iterating the design üîÑ</h3>
          <p>
            Following the user flow, we designed wireframes for the screens most essential to the concept.
      </p>
          <p>
            Between wireframes and the final prototype, we tested the app with <b>6</b> Stanford Rideshare members and other Stanford affiliates.
      </p>
          <p>We followed the <b>highly iterative RITE method:</b> after each test, we implemented improvements so following users could provide feedback and validate them.

          <p>Here are a few of the changes we made:</p>

                <ul>
                  <li>Added leave and arrival times because this helped users decide between carpools more than their names</li>
                  <li>Added Home and Work icons next to clarify what to input in location fields</li>
                </ul>

                <ul>

                  <li>Repeated card design from the carpool listings to help users understand this calendar is showing their upcoming rides</li>

              <div>
                <h3>Just the essentials</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>Removed live locations because it wasn‚Äôt helpful to users</li>
                  <li>Provided a cancel option so users can quickly communicate they can‚Äôt make it</li>

      <h5>STYLE</h5>
      <h3>Communicating visually</h3>
      <p>To make sure my partner and I designed the high-fidelity prototype consistently, I developed a style tile. I wanted to <b>evoke nature and the world outside.</b> Many users we interviewed cited helping the environment as a reason they joined Stanford Rideshare, so I wanted to remind people of the good they can do by joining a carpool. </p>

          <h5>REFLECTION</h5>
          <h3>Future product possibilities</h3>
          <p>We discovered some problems in user research that we didn‚Äôt have time to design solutions for. We also focused just on Stanford Rideshare throughout this project, but I thought a bit about how this product could potentially grow and be monetized. Here were a few of my ideas:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <b>Expand to more workplaces</b>
              <p>Growing the user base could lead to better recommendations and more optimized gas-saving routes. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Facilitate the driving rotation</b>
              <p>Journie could guide the process of scheduling who‚Äôs driving which day so everyone is on the same page.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Handle payments and transactions</b>
              <p>It‚Äôs a hassle to split the costs for gas and vehicle maintenance. Journie could make this process more efficient and charge a small fee.
</p>
            </li>
          </ol>

          <h3>Lessons I learned</h3>
          <b>Screen users before interviewing them</b>
          <p>I found users to interview by emailing carpoolers on the Stanford Rideshare website. So I was very surprised when the first thing an interviewee told me was that she never managed to join a carpool! Her unsuccessful attempt at joining was insightful, but I could have been more prepared for the interview if I‚Äôd uncovered this information in advance. </p>
          <b>User feedback trumps design patterns</b>
          <p>I love studying other apps‚Äôs interfaces, but their choices might not present the best solution for the problem I‚Äôm solving. When conducting user testing, we realized some design patterns we incorporated in our early prototypes were actually confusing or unintuitive for users.
