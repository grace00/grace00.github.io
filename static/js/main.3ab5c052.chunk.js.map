Recently, the rise of competitors that target younger audiences has put a strain on the company’s traffic statistics.

We found that sites aimed at a young adult demographic like Healthline curate more wellness- and lifestyle-focused content and write with more relatable voices. They also emphasize diverse imagery, include LGBTQ health information, and exhibit young people’s medical stories more than WebMD. More established publishers such as MayoClinic and CNN Health had the advantage of high perceived credibility.</p>\n            </div>\n\n            <h2>User Research</h2>\n            <p>We conducted a 21-question survey on Gen Z’s health habits, how they receive health information, and their opinions of WebMD.

As a result, they may shy away from WebMD because they associate the site with illness, particularly cancer. </p>\n            <p>Gen Zers also expressed a desire for a redesigned homepage that is “cleaner,” “easier to navigate,” and has a “more dynamic, social-media-esque layout.”</p>\n            <div className=\"outline\">\n                <p>The current WebMD homepage emphasizes medical conditions and appears cluttered to Gen Zers, which discourages them from visiting the site more often.</p>\n            </div>\n\n            <h2>Solution: Creating a Landing Page for Gen Zers</h2>\n            <p>After brainstorming recommendations to attract Gen Zers to WebMD, we each took one to develop and present. I chose to work on fleshing out the concept of a landing page (also called health centers) on WebMD’s site aimed at the Gen Z demographic.\n</p>\n            <h3>Content Strategy</h3>\n            <p>Drawing on our survey results and my SEO knowledge, I created a possible strategy for the landing page’s content.\n</p>\n            <table>\n                <tr>\n                    <td width=\"20%\">Target audience</td>\n                    <td>18-25 (population: 30 million)</td>\n                </tr>\n                <tr>\n                    <td>Content formats</td>\n                    <td>Articles and videos</td>\n                </tr>\n                <tr>\n                    <td>Content topics</td>\n                    <td>Fitness, nutrition, mental health, body positivity, skincare, beauty, sexual/reproductive health, disease prevention</td>\n                </tr>\n                <tr>\n                    <td>Language</td>\n                    <td>Address the audience directly with second-person language to come across as more inviting and understanding</td>\n                </tr>\n            </table>\n            <p>To provide a more specific picture of the page’s content, I came up with over 20 possible pitches. I also wanted each pitch to have high SEO potential, so I analyzed keyword volume, competition, and content gaps using Keywords Everywhere and seoClarity. </p>\n            <p>In terms of business, I learned that the Gen Z page could help diversify revenue streams. WebMD struggles to engage with consumer packaged goods advertising, but including more wellness content could get more views to attract these brands.\n</p>\n            <h3>Design</h3>\n            <p>After finding content Gen Z would enjoy, I helped design the interface it could be housed in. I studied sites popular with Gen Zers such as BuzzFeed and Huffington Post to see how they attract an audience. I noted that these sites prioritize relatable article content and had easy-to-understand categories such as “Trending Now.”\n</p>\n            <p>For the site’s design, I chose the colors yellow, blue, and pink so it could have broad appeal while seeming youthful and positive. I brainstormed and wrote headlines that address the topics Gen Z is most interested in, incorporating words like “you” where appropriate. Because Gen Z is the most diverse generation, I found images that reflected that. I sent all of this content to the designer, communicating that I wanted the mockup to emphasize article content and have clear categories.\n</p>\n            <p>Here was the final mockup (for comparison, the current Teen Health Center is on the left).</p>\n            <div className=\"mockup overflow\">\n                <img className=\"left\" src={teencenter} />\n                <img src={genzcenter} />\n            </div>\n            <h2>Reflection</h2>\n            <p>For the majority of the project, I actually didn’t know much about “UI/UX” (if you mentioned affinity maps to me, I probably would’ve just pictured two globes kissing).

Instead of mean girls, there are judgmental genius teens horny for the Ivy Leagues. Instead of bullying, there’s racism against Asians. Instead of insane parties with alcohol, there are nights of studying that are equally long and exhausting. A major motivation of mine was to depict a version of high school/teendom that is far more realistic to me but I haven’t seen much in today’s popular culture. I explore the insanely stressful culture high school can cultivate, the role social media (particularly Instagram) plays in teenagers’ lives, and what coming-of-age can look like for Asian-Americans.

I knew I wanted to write a comedy about an Asian-American girl surviving high school, so I also re-watched and read the screenplays of <i>Eighth Grade</i>, <i>Mean Girls</i>, and <i>Bridesmaids</i>. Studying these helped me solidify my logline and character list.\n                </p>\n                <div className=\"image-row\">\n                <img src={screenwritersbible} />\n                <img src={savethecat} />\n                <img src={eighthgrade} />\n                <img src={meangirls} />\n                <img src={bridesmaids} />\n                </div>\n                <div className=\"quote\">Logline: Lena Yang struggles to become extraordinary in her junior year of high school after realizing she’s fallen behind her peers and that her parents are disappointed in her.</div>\n\n                <h2>Outlining and Defining</h2>\n                <p>To flesh out the main characters, I thought carefully about their flaws, possible character arcs, and goals in addition to their general personality traits. What do they want at the beginning of the story? What needs of theirs are fulfilled in the end? After writing their biographies, I then brainstormed possible scenes and ordered them into a detailed outline of the three acts. </p>\n            </div>\n\n            <h2>Writing, Procrastinating, and More Writing</h2>\n            <p>Because contest participants were given deadlines every Friday and I was doing an internship during the week, I frequently stayed up until 3AM pumping out lines of dialogue. Teen characters’ lines flowed right out of me, but I often found myself halting and sputtering when trying to write what a teacher or parent would say. I also worked hard to balance the comedy with serious moments, include authentic details about Chinese culture, and make the characters’ actions consistent with the biographies I established. After completing the first draft, I had enough time to re-write the entire third act before I needed to submit my screenplay.</p>\n            <h2>Result</h2>\n            <p>The contest started with 123 writers; 21 finished. My screenplay was voted by Screenwriters Network members to end up in the top 10 (what?!). Two people messaged me their suggestions and notes for my screenplay, which was incredibly generous of them. The best surprise, however, was finding this message in my inbox months after the contest had ended:</p>\n            <img src={discordcomment} />\n            <div className=\"smallText center-text\">Even <i>I'd</i> think I made this up</div>\n            <p>I didn’t expect anyone to take the time to read my screenplay all the way through, so I was shocked that someone had good things to say about it. </p>\n\n            <h2>Takeaways</h2>\n            <p>Experiencing the screenwriting process has changed the way I look at movies -- and people -- forever. I’ve internalized the three-act story structure and become familiar with the kinds of twists that can occur. I’ve learned how to better understand people’s desires and frustrations as well as how these drive them to certain actions. And I’ve gotten better at tackling large creative tasks in a relatively short amount of time.</p>\n            <img src={whizkid3} />\n            <div className=\"smallText center-text\">SPOILER ALERT!!!

For example, as much as I’d love to provide job recommendations for each user, I know my machine learning skills aren’t quite up to par.\n</p>\n      <h3>Job Seeker</h3>\n      <table>\n        <tr>\n          <th>Needs</th>\n          <th>Design Feature</th>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"37%\">Find open positions that suit their interests and qualifications\n</td>\n          <td>Allow students to search and filter through jobs\n            <div>Provide a list of jobs, each with details and instructions to apply</div>\n          </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td>Connect with recruiters and employees at companies</td>\n          <td>Provide a prominent email address to contact for every posting\n</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td>Deal with rejection and loneliness throughout the process</td>\n          <td>Show articles written by other students about their experiences and advice</td>\n        </tr>\n      </table>\n\n      <h3>Stanford Daily</h3>\n      <table>\n        <tr>\n          <th>Needs</th>\n          <th>Design Feature</th>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"40%\">Earn extra money\n</td>\n          <td>Implement payment processing</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td>Attract views on the Stanford Daily website</td>\n          <td>Include links to articles in the Daily</td>\n        </tr>\n      </table>\n\n      <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>\n      <p>I analyzed popular job search sites for Stanford students to analyze what needs they met or did not meet.\n  </p>\n      <img src={jobcompetitors} />\n      <p>Many of the sites had robust filters and provided extra information such as company reviews to better inform prospective applicants. The majority, however, tended to provide somewhat impersonal experiences: click on a job, fill out a form, submit it into the void, and repeat. Handshake stood out by providing upbeat advice written by my school’s career center, information about school career events, and personalized advice about different careers. I found that none of the sites provided advice written by students themselves.</p>\n\n      <h2>User Flow</h2>\n      <p>Feeling a little overwhelmed by the task in front of me, I outlined the most important paths users could take through the website. This helped me get an idea of the web pages I’d need to create and develop.</p>\n      <img src={jobflow} className=\"center-image\" />\n\n      <p>Using this diagram, I developed low-fidelity wireframes.</p>\n      <div className=\"wireframe overflow\">\n        <div className=\"image-row\">\n          <img src={landingwireframe} />\n          <img src={jobwireframe} />\n          <img src={detailswireframe} />\n          <img src={advicewireframe} />\n        </div>\n      </div>\n\n      <h2>Style Decisions</h2>\n      <div className=\"design\">\n        <img src={landing} />\n        <p>For the UI of the site, I aimed for it to have a youthful, welcoming appearance while feeling cleanly professional. I wanted the site to be associated with Stanford without feeling academic and instructional, so I chose red and green as the main colors but brightened them to provide a friendlier tone and avoid reminding students of their looming pile of p-sets. I didn’t want the red to instill a sense of alarm or danger, so I calmed it to be more pink-like.\n</p>\n        <p>I chose the font Source Sans Pro for the body to make the job descriptions and titles seem less intimidating and more inviting.</p>\n      </div>\n\n      <h2>Developed Designs</h2>\n      <p>After creating high-fidelity prototypes in Adobe XD, I have been developing the website using React, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. I am still working on the back-end development, but the front-end is very close to the finalized appearance. Check out the current demo <a href=\"https://thestanforddaily.github.io/jobs-board/#/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\n\n      <h3>Jobs List</h3>\n      <p>As the application process is time-consuming enough, I wanted to make it as fast as possible for the user to find the jobs they are interested in. Users can search, filter, and quickly scan each job for important details.\n</p>\n      <a href=\"https://thestanforddaily.github.io/jobs-board/#/jobs\" target=\"_blank\"><img src={jobslist} className=\"center-image shadow\" /></a>\n      <div className=\"smallText center-text\">Click me!</div>\n      <h3>Jobs Details</h3>\n      <p>Students can learn more about each job by viewing the job description, company website, application instructions, and more.</p>\n      <img src={jobdetails} className=\"center-image shadow\" />\n      <div className=\"smallText center-text\">Details pulled from GitHub Jobs API</div>\n      <h3>Advice</h3>\n      <p>When taking a break from job-seeking, users can read articles related to jobs and internships to get the honest perspectives of other students.\n</p>\n      <a href=\"https://thestanforddaily.github.io/jobs-board/#/advice\" target=\"_blank\"><img src={advice} className=\"center-image shadow\" /></a>\n      <h3>Post Job</h3>\n      <p>Recruiters and other company representatives can quickly fill out the details about their job opportunity and payment information. The email field is mandatory to allow students to connect with a real person right away and form relationships with companies.\n</p>\n      <a href=\"https://thestanforddaily.github.io/jobs-board/#/post\" target=\"_blank\"><img src={postjob} className=\"center-image shadow reduce-size\" /></a>\n      <h3>Behind-the-Scenes Development Details:</h3>\n      <ul>\n        <li>The page currently pulls job data from the GitHub Jobs API for display.  It doesn’t have a category for “industry,” so I’ve set them all to be “technology.”</li>\n        <li>I implemented the search bar and location filter. I’m currently working on connecting the “Post Job” form fields to the WordPress API so I can make the other filters work.\n</li>\n        <li>I made the site responsive -- try it on your phone!</li>\n        <li>The online job posting form contains placeholder information to help me test it more efficiently.</li>\n        <li>To get the Daily articles, I identified posts with tags such as “career,” “job,” “internship,” etc. </li>\n      </ul>\n\n      <h2>The Future</h2>\n      <p>I’m currently finishing up the development of the site. The business team will handle advertising, finding companies, etc., and I’ve been working with them to ensure the product aligns with the Stanford Daily business.\n</p>\n\n      <h2>Reflection</h2>\n      <p>Six months ago, I didn’t know how websites worked, I hadn’t heard of visual hierarchy/personas/Balsamiq, and most shockingly of all, I didn’t know the difference between “hover” and “focus.” Designing and developing my first website has been an incredible learning experience, opening me up to the world of design and the technology that brings it to life. I love learning, and because of this project, I learned how to empathize with users, develop wireframes and user flows, and integrate myself with the design community. I’ve pushed my limits countless times working on this, and I’ve discovered more that I want to surpass: I want to learn how to incorporate animation and storytelling into interface designs, create push notifications and email alerts from web content, and code recommendation algorithms that I can one day implement. That’s where I’m headed next.</p>\n    </div >\n  );\n}\n\nexport default JobsBoard;\n","import React from 'react';\nimport './styles.css';\nimport vrgame from './images/vrgamefull.png'\n\nfunction JobsBoard() {\n    return (\n        <div className=\"project\">\n            <img src={vrgame} />\n            <h1 className=\"projTitle\">SoundOff</h1>\n            <p className=\"subtitle\">A VR sound game for kids.</p>\n\n            <div className=\"row\">\n                <div className=\"column\">\n                    <h4>Duration:</h4><p>3 weeks</p>\n                </div>\n                <div className=\"column\">\n                    <h4>Teammates:</h4><p>Just me</p>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            <p>I believe the strongest emotional reactions to films are evoked with sound. The harp weeping as a character dies, the violins swelling during a kiss. But in movies, sound can be constrained to a flat screen. VR headsets like the Oculus Go, on the other hand, offer powerful spatial audio in addition to 360 visuals. When it came time to create a project in my class CS11: Intro to VR Design & Development, I wondered how I could make a VR experience with sound at its core.\n\n            <h2>The Idea</h2>\n            <p>I decided to create a game where players listen and try to pinpoint where audio cues are coming from. As children, we all learn the sounds animals make; it’s almost as important to our education as learning to tie our shoes. So my game was set on a farm. At the beginning of the game, players stand in the middle of a farm and hear sounds created by multiple sources. When they point and click a source, its sound stops: silence is golden.</p>\n\n            <h2>Creation Process</h2>\n            <p>To create the farm scene, I arranged several assets I found online and set up the lighting and camera positions. I connected the assets to sound clips, and configured them in Unity so that triggering the source would silence its sound.</p>\n\n            <h2>Outcome</h2>\n            <p>During my class’s demo day, several people tried out my game. I learned that the instructions were easy to miss, so in the future, I should try creating a separate screen with the instructions placed directly in front of players' eyes. People seemed to enjoy clicking the sounds away once they learned how the game worked.</p>\n            </p>\n        </div>\n    );\n}\n\nexport default JobsBoard;\n","import React from 'react';\nimport ReactGA from 'react-ga';\nimport { createBrowserHistory } from 'history';\nimport { Switch, BrowserRouter as Router, Route } from \"react-router-dom\";\nimport './index.css';\nimport NavBar from './components/NavBar';\nimport Writing from './components/Writing';\nimport Projects from './components/Projects';\nimport WebMD from './components/WebMD.jsx';\nimport WhizKid from './components/WhizKid.jsx';\nimport JobsBoard from './components/JobsBoard.jsx';\nimport SoundOff from './components/SoundOff';\nimport handicon from './components/images/handicon.png';\nimport eyeicon from './components/images/eyeicon.png';\nimport youngme from './components/images/youngme.png';\n\nconst history = createBrowserHistory();\n\n// Initialize google analytics page view tracking\nhistory.listen(location => {\n  ReactGA.set({ page: location.pathname }); // Update the user's current page\n  ReactGA.pageview(location.pathname); // Record a pageview for the given page\n});\n\nclass App extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <div>\n        <Router basename=\"/portfolio\">\n          <NavBar />\n          <Switch>\n            <Route exact path='/' component={Projects} />\n            <Route exact path='/webmd-gen-z' component={WebMD} />\n            <Route exact path='/daily-job-site' component={JobsBoard} />\n            <Route exact path='/whiz-kid' component={WhizKid} />\n            <Route exact path='/sound-off' component={SoundOff} />\n            <Route exact path='/about' component={About} />\n            <Route exact path='/writing' component={Writing} />\n            <Route path='*' component={Projects} />\n          </Switch>\n          <Footer />\n        </Router>\n      </div >\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default App;\n\nfunction About() {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"project\">\n      <img src={youngme} style={{width: \"300px\", display: \"block\", margin: \"0 auto\", borderRadius: \"10px\"}}/>\n      <p>Hi, I’m Grace!
