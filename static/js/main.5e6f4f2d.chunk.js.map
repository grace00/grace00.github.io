While transcription software exists, it only aids one of many steps in a journalist’s interview and writing process.</p>\n\n      <h2>Solution</h2>\n      <p>In CS 206: Exploring Computational Journalism, I and two teammates built Leaflet, a web platform that <b>bridges audio, transcripts, and notes in meaningful ways to optimize the journalist’s workflow</b>. Leaflet allows journalists to receive automated transcripts of their recordings, research related news, link their handwritten notes to their transcriptions, save quotes for later, and begin crafting their stories.\n</p>\n      <h2>My Contribution</h2>\n      <ul>\n        <li>In the research phase, I <b>conducted competitive analysis, interviews, and created a journey map</b> to synthesize our findings.\n</li>\n        <li>I made paper sketches and <b>created a prototype in Figma</b> that was later developed for the final interface.\n</li>\n        <li>I researched and selected the computer vision and speech-to-text APIs used in the final product.\n</li>\n        <li>I <b>programmed the frontend and backend of nearly every feature</b>, including automated speech-to-text transcription, audio playback tools, handwritten-to-digital notes conversion with computer vision, the quote bank, and related news search features.\n</li>\n        <li>I <b>conducted all the usability testing sessions</b> and incorporated the feedback into the final developed product.</li>\n      </ul>\n\n      <div className=\"full-width section-container blue\">\n        <div className=\"project\">\n          <h2>Demo</h2>\n          <video width=\"100%\" controls>\n            <source src={demo} type=\"video/mp4\" />\n        Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n</video>\n          <div className=\"small-text\">Note: Leaflet has already transcribed the reporter's audio file and converted a picture of their notes into digitized text using computer vision.</div>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n      <h2>Research</h2>\n      <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>\n      <p>Before creating the application, we studied five popular transcription tools. We input real audio from interviews to gauge their accuracy and available features.\n</p>\n      <img src={Competitors} />\n      <p>Nearly every tool provided a correction interface for the transcript, identified different speakers, and showed timestamps. However, <b> none had features that specifically targeted the reporting process – the tools’ capabilities were general in order to please wider audiences</b>. As a result, they didn’t help users with much beyond transcribing audio, which is often just one step of a user’s workflow.</p>\n\n      <h3>Interviews</h3>\n      <p>We spoke to local reporters at The Stanford Daily and industry reporters to gain greater understanding of their workflow and how transcription fits into it.\n</p>\n      <p>We gained these insights:</p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>Before doing an interview or attending an event, reporters <b>conduct research</b> to gain context about their subject.</li>\n        <li>While recording audio at these events, they <b>limit the presence of electronic devices</b> to avoid distracting others.\n</li>\n        <li>Journalists usually <b>take handwritten notes</b> when interviewing to make note of important points, and they often include timestamps.\n</li>\n        <li>Student journalists <b>record audio during interviews</b> and <b>transcribe it later with automated transcription software</b></li>\n        <li>Journalists <b>use their notes to locate key sections</b> of the interview/transcript to incorporate into their story.\n</li>\n        <li>Many journalists store quotes from transcripts in their own makeshift \"<b>quote banks</b>,” which they draw on when writing.\n</li>\n      </ul>\n      <p>Our results and technical abilities led us to focus on creating an <b>unintrusive web transcription tool that helps journalists identify important information in their audio to use in their stories</b>.</p>\n\n      <h3>Journey Mapping</h3>\n      <p>With the insights from our research, I mapped out a reporter’s typical writing process to identify opportunities for our tool to help.</p>\n      <img src={JourneyMap} className=\"shadow\" />\n\n      <h2>Design</h2>\n      <h3>Ideation</h3>\n      <p>After learning about journalists’ transcription needs and processes, we brainstormed and discussed ideas for features that would be useful for a reporter before, during, and after transcribing. Beyond the main functionality of transcribing audio, we decided to focus on these features:\n</p>\n      <ul>\n        <li><b>Quote bank</b> for saving and storing notable quotes </li>\n        <li><b>News search</b> for finding related published stories </li>\n        <li><b>Correctional interface</b> for editing the automated transcript</li>\n        <li><b>Conversion of handwritten notes to digitized text</b> that links back to the transcript using computer vision</li>\n      </ul>\n      <p>We considered many other ideas but ultimately chose these to fit within time and technical constraints.</p>\n\n      <h3>User Feedback</h3>\n      <p>We conducted a survey to learn more about journalists’ processes and what they thought of our ideas. From the respondents, we learned that:</p>\n      <div className=\"box-container\">\n        <div className=\"box\"><div>Transcription is the most time-consuming part of their writing process.</div></div>\n        <div className=\"box\"><div>Most of them currently use automated transcription software.</div></div>\n        <div className=\"box\"><div>All of them replay parts of their audio to collect exact quotes for their stories.</div></div>\n        <div className=\"box\"><div>They take notes during interviews and would use a digital note-taking feature.</div></div>\n        <div className=\"box\"><div>All reported that a quote bank would be useful and that they would use it.</div></div>\n      </div>\n\n      <h3>Prototypes</h3>\n      <p>I created sketches and prototypes for our team to get an idea of the application’s visual structure and technical requirements.</p>\n      <div className=\"large-overflow\">\n        <div className=\"image-row\">\n          <img src={Sketch} className=\"shadow\" />\n          {/*<img src={LowFi} className=\"shadow\" />*/}\n          <img src={HiFi} className=\"shadow\" />\n        </div>\n      </div>\n\n      <h3>Usability Testing</h3>\n      <p>After beginning development, I conducted usability testing with journalists. I asked them to complete a series of tasks while expressing their thoughts out loud as well as questions about their experiences with transcribing audio.\n</p>\n      <img src={Test1} className=\"shadow\" />\n      <div className=\"small-text\">Interface presented to users in the first round of testing</div>\n      <img src={Test2} className=\"shadow\" />\n      <div className=\"small-text\">Interface presented to users in the second round of testing</div>\n\n      <p>I found that:</p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>Users <b>liked the quote bank</b> and had no trouble using it.</li>\n        <li>To search for related news, they always used the search box instead of the “Search Highlighted Words” button.</li>\n        <li>A technical bug caused the quotes in the quote bank to be wiped out whenever the user switched to a different tab.</li>\n        <li>They <b>expressed desire to save or pin the news articles</b> they found for later.</li>\n      </ul>\n      <p>As a result of these findings, I made changes to the design and code.</p>\n\n\n      <div className=\"full-width section-container gray\">\n        <div className=\"project\">\n          <h2>Development</h2>\n\n          <h3>Choosing the Foundations</h3>\n          <p>Leaflet was made with a <b>React frontend and Python backend</b>. We also drew upon <b>Flask, Semantic UI, Microsoft Computer Vision, Google Speech-to-Text, and News API</b>.</p>\n          <p>We used React for the foundation of the interface and Semantic UI for basic visual components such as buttons, icons, and input. Due to time constraints, we were unable to change the default font, font sizes, and a few other aesthetic elements to be exactly like our planned design, but Semantic UI did heavily streamline our frontend development.\n</p>\n\n          <h3>Programming the Functionalities</h3>\n          <p>That left a daunting task ahead of me: programming and manipulating the backend to curate the content we wanted to display. <b>Computer vision for converting images of handwritten notes into digitized text was the first feature I implemented</b>. After testing and researching different computer vision APIs that could recognize written characters, I chose Microsoft’s for its low cost and relatively high accuracy. I created a Python script to communicate with the API and used Flask to pass in images users uploaded to the interface. </p>\n          <p>To implement automated transcription, I followed a similar process. I selected Google’s Speech-to-Text for video API as it seemed to be the most accurate free service. Additionally, it provided useful features like speaker separation. With the data sent from the API, I was able to <b>implement specialized audio features to help users navigate the transcript and audio</b>. These included transcript-audio word matching (click on a word in the transcript and the corresponding audio plays), live highlighting (the word being played gets highlighted), visual separation of speakers, and more.</p>\n          <img src={Code} />\n          <a href=\"https://github.com/chloebarreau/leafletnotebook/commits/master\" target=\"_blank\" className=\"btn-big\">View GitHub</a>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n      <h2>Final Product</h2>\n      <p>After weeks of furious developing, we created the final version of Leaflet: a modern transcription application designed to help journalists at every stage of their writing process.</p>\n      <img src={LeafletFinal} className=\"shadow\" />\n\n      <h3>Transcription</h3>\n      <p>Journalists can upload an audio file and receive an automated transcript quickly.</p>\n      <img src={Transcription} className=\"shadow\" />\n\n      <h3>Playback Tools</h3>\n      <p>Journalists can easily verify quotes by clicking on a word, which will play the audio from that word.

Some key findings were:</p>\n            <ul>\n                <li>Our biggest health concern is <b>managing stress and mental health</b>\n</li>\n                <li>Having a <b>balanced diet, exercising, and getting enough sleep</b> are also important to us\n</li>\n                <li>We feel the need for <b>acceptance and belonging</b>\n</li>\n                <li>We’re the most <b>ethnically diverse</b> generation in the US so far\n</li>\n            </ul>\n            <div className=\"small-text\">Z: A Generation Redefining Health and Wellness, Into Z Future</div>\n            <p>Our top health priorities are related to <b>general lifestyle</b> rather than specific medical conditions. \n</p>\n\n            <h2>Studying Competitors</h2>\n            <div className=\"image-row-small\">\n                <img className=\"competitor\" src=\"https://corporate-wordpress-proxy-stage.healthline.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Healthline-Black-Lockup-1.png\" alt=\"\" />\n                <img className=\"competitor\" src=\"https://pmdbeauty.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/self-magazine-logo.jpg\" alt=\"\"/>\n                <img className=\"competitor\" src=\"http://jj-la.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/mbg-full-logo-black.png\" alt=\"\"></img>\n                <img className=\"competitor\" src=\"https://katiebressack.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/28-4449-page/mbg-logo-300x152.png\" alt=\"\"/>\n                <img className=\"competitor\" src=\"https://www.media24.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Womenshealth_logo.png\" alt=\"\"/>\n                <img className=\"competitor\" src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/966067059913183232/owoXoAMB_400x400.jpg\" alt=\"\"/>\n            </div>\n            <p>We looked at six other health information and news sites to study how they appeal to Gen Z. We learned that sites aimed at a young adult demographic like Healthline curate more wellness- and lifestyle-focused content and write with more relatable voices than WebMD does currently. They also incorporate more diverse imagery, include more LGBTQ health information, and exhibit more young people’s medical stories than WebMD. \n</p>\n\n\n            <h2>User Research</h2>\n            <p>We needed to know more about our target audience, so we conducted a survey on Gen Z’s health habits, how they receive health information, and their perception of WebMD. There were 202 respondents, most between 20-22 years old. Some of our key insights included:\n</p>\n            <div class=\"box-container\">\n                <div class=\"box\"><div>Gen Z is generally <b>healthy</b> and is most interested in the topics <b>food and diet, mental health, fitness, and body positivity</b>. \n</div>\n                </div>\n                <div class=\"box\"><div>Gen Z wants a <b>redesigned homepage</b> that is “cleaner,” “easier to navigate,” and has a “more dynamic, social-media-esque layout.”\n</div></div>\n                <div class=\"box\"><div>The current WebMD website emphasizes illnesses like <b>cancer, their biggest fear</b> by far, which <b>discourages them from visiting the site</b>  more often. </div></div>\n                <div class=\"box\"><div>They most prefer getting health information in <b>article</b> form, followed by <b>video</b> — and least prefer getting it from an app.\n</div></div>\n            </div>\n            <a href={surveystats} target=\"_blank\" className=\"btn-big\">See More Results</a>\n\n            <div className=\"outline\">\n                <p>The results further emphasized that Gen Z enjoys learning about wellness and lifestyle topics. However, they associate WebMD with the very opposite: sickness and life-threatening diseases. On top of that, they don’t find the design appealing and easy to navigate. <b>These findings motivated us to design a health center would better target our generation’s needs.</b>\n</p>\n            </div>\n\n            <h2>Solution: Creating a Gen Z Health Center\n</h2>\n            <p>After brainstorming multiple recommendations improve WebMD’s relationship with Gen Z, we each chose one to develop and present. I took on the idea of designing a new health center for WebMD’s website. It would target Gen Z’s interests in a way the rest of the site couldn’t.\n</p>\n            <h3>Content Strategy</h3>\n            <p>Drawing on our research and my SEO knowledge, I created a strategy for its content to best address Gen Z’s health concerns and interests.\n</p>\n            <table>\n                <tr>\n                    <td width=\"20%\">Target audience</td>\n                    <td>18-25 (population: 30 million)</td>\n                </tr>\n                <tr>\n                    <td>Content formats</td>\n                    <td>Articles and videos</td>\n                </tr>\n                <tr>\n                    <td>Content topics</td>\n                    <td>Fitness, nutrition, mental health, body positivity, skincare, beauty, sexual/reproductive health, disease prevention</td>\n                </tr>\n                <tr>\n                    <td>Language</td>\n                    <td>Address the audience directly with second-person language to come across as more inviting and understanding</td>\n                </tr>\n            </table>\n            <p>To provide a more specific picture of the page’s content, I came up with over 20 possible pitches. I also wanted each pitch to have <b>high SEO potential</b>, so I analyzed keyword volume, competition, and content gaps using the tools <a href=\"https://keywordseverywhere.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Keywords Everywhere</a> and <a href=\"https://www.seoclarity.net/\" target=\"_blank\">seoClarity</a>. </p>\n            <p>In terms of business, I learned that the <b>Gen Z page could help diversify revenue streams</b>. WebMD struggles to engage with consumer packaged goods advertising, but including more wellness content could get more views to attract these brands.\n</p>\n            <h3>Design</h3>\n            <p>After finding content Gen Z would enjoy, I worked with a designer to mockup a clean interface to house it in. Here was the final mockup (for comparison, the current Women’s Health Center is on the left):\n</p>\n            <div className=\"mockup overflow\">\n                <img src={genzmock} />\n            </div>\n            <h2>Takeaways</h2>\n            <h3>Design with Business in Mind</h3>\n            <p>Working on this project taught me the importance of developing solutions that meet user and business needs. An idea can be incredibly useful and well executed, but to increase its chances of survival it should clearly benefit the company. If I were to do this project again I would work on aligning the final product to better support WebMD’s business goals while keeping user needs in mind.</p>\n            <h3>What UX Is</h3>\n            <p>For the majority of the project, I actually didn’t know much about “UI/UX.” What I did know was that I loved gathering data and making design and content decisions with them. A valuable lesson I took away from this project was that what I loved doing — researching and creating meaningful experiences with the potential to help people — had a name. Oh, and don’t mention cancer around Gen Z.</p>\n\n        </div>\n    );\n}\n\nexport default WebMD;\n","import React from 'react';\nimport { HashLink as Link } from 'react-router-hash-link';\nimport './styles.css';\nimport Preview from './images/journie-project-preview.png'\nimport Report from './images/CS206_Paper.pdf';\nimport InterviewGuide from './images/journie-interview-guide.png';\nimport InterviewNotes from './images/journie-interview-notes.png';\nimport JourneyMap from './images/journie-journey-map.png';\nimport Brainstorm from './images/journie-brainstorm.png';\nimport Blueprint from './images/journie-blueprint.png';\nimport ComparatorGuide from './images/journie-comparator-guide.png';\nimport ComparatorResults from './images/journie-comparative.png';\nimport NitsNeeds from './images/journie-nits-needs.png';\nimport Sketches from './images/journie-sketches.jpg';\nimport PaperPrototype from './images/journie-prototype.jpeg';\nimport Prototype1 from './images/journie-prototype1.png';\nimport Flow from './images/journie-flow.png';\nimport Wireframes from './images/journie-wireframes.png';\nimport StyleTile from './images/journie-style-tile.png';\nimport UserTest from './images/journie-user-test.jpg'\nimport Onboard from './images/journie-onboard.gif';\nimport Info from './images/journie-info.gif';\nimport Join from './images/journie-join.gif';\nimport Morning from './images/journie-morning.gif';\nimport OnboardIteration from './images/journie-onboard.png';\nimport InfoIteration from './images/journie-info.png';\nimport CalendarIteration from './images/journie-calendar.png';\nimport MorningIteration from './images/journie-morning.png';\n\n\nfunction Journie() {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"project journie\">\n      <div className=\"overlay green full-width no-border-radius\">\n        <h1 className=\"project-title\">\n          Journie\n        </h1>\n        <p className=\"subtitle\">Matching commuters to carpools.</p>\n        <img src={Preview} />\n      </div>\n\n      <div className=\"row\">\n        <h4>Overview</h4>\n        <span className=\"proj-detail\">Journie is a project I worked on for a service design class.

Journie could make this process more efficient and charge a small fee.\n</p>\n            </li>\n          </ol>\n\n          <h3>Lessons I learned</h3>\n          <b>Screen users before interviewing them</b>\n          <p>I found users to interview by emailing carpoolers on the Stanford Rideshare website.

As I copy-pasted my resume into little boxes again and again, just hoping for a whiff of acknowledgement, I kept hearing about how others had landed amazing opportunities.\n</p>\n      <p><b>Applying to jobs and internships can be an unfamiliar, lonely, and taxing process for students</b>. It’s difficult to even find positions that match your interests, and after submitting your application you might never hear back.\n</p>\n\n      <h2>Solution</h2>\n      <p>I designed and developed Job Tree, a jobs search site for <i>The Stanford Daily</i> that  <b>helps make applying to jobs a friendlier and less isolating process</b>. Job Tree connects talented students to companies they might not otherwise know about, and it reassures them that they’re not alone in their struggles.\n</p>\n\n      <h2>The First Try</h2>\n      <p>I volunteered to create the site towards the end of my freshman year. I’d never designed or developed a website before, so my first instinct was to look at job sites for inspiration and then dive into coding. Whenever I wanted to change the color of a button or adjust spacing between elements, I went into my CSS file, fiddled with the code, and prayed to the heavens before refreshing the page.\n</p>\n      <img src={oldjobsboard} className=\"shadow\" />\n      <div className=\"small-text\">This took an embarrassing amount of time!</div>\n      <h2>The Second Try: Survey Insights</h2>\n      <p>I took a break from the project to intern at WebMD. When I came back, I realized I needed to approach the website differently in order to create one that was empathetic towards students like myself.\n</p>\n      <p>I renamed my React project folder “old-jobs-board” and created a new one. </p>\n      <p>Then, I sent out a survey to Stanford students. I hoped to learn what students find frustrating about the application process, what they look for in a job, what helps them land opportunities, etc. I learned that...\n</p>\n      <div class=\"box-container\">\n        <div class=\"box\"><div><b>Company industry, pay, and location</b> are the most important factors they consider when applying to a job\n</div></div>\n        <div class=\"box\"><div><b>Having connections with companies</b>  is important to them and their success in finding internships\n</div></div>\n        <div class=\"box\"><div>They want to know more about <b>other students’ experiences and advice</b>  when it comes to job-hunting\n</div></div>\n        <div class=\"box\"><div>They <b>use job search sites</b>, with Handshake being the most-liked one\n</div></div>\n        <div class=\"box\"><div>They dislike <b>getting rejected</b> and \"having to dig through all the requirements” to see if they qualify for a position.\n</div></div>\n      </div>\n\n      <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>\n      <p>I looked at popular job search sites to study how they help students find jobs and why the problem hadn’t been solved yet.\n  </p>\n      <img src={jobcompetitors} />\n      <p>Many sites had robust filters and provided special information such as company reviews to better inform prospective applicants. I found that the majority, however, tended to shuffle the hopefuls through an impersonal application process: click on a job, fill out a form, submit it into the void, and repeat. Only the Stanford Alumni Job & Internship Board provided an easy way to get in touch with a real person at the company. From the survey, I knew that having a connection like that is a tremendous advantage for students.</p>\n<p>I observed that most of the sites didn’t attempt to help job seekers deal with feelings of rejection. Handshake was the only exception, providing kind advice written by my school’s career center. None of the sites provided advice written by students themselves.\n</p>\n<p>Through this analysis, I learned that the market overall <b>does not meet students’ desires to form relationships with employees at companies, deal with negative feelings in the job application process, and learn from other students</b>.\n</p>\n\n      <h2>Identifying Needs</h2>\n      <p>Using my research, I identified the biggest needs of Stanford job seekers and <i>The Stanford Daily</i>. I also brainstormed ideas of how my website could address them. Since I was going to be coding each solution myself, they had to be feasible for me to implement in a reasonable amount of time as a first-time web developer. (For instance, as much as I’d love to provide personalized job recommendations for each user, I know my machine learning skills aren’t quite up to par.)\n</p>\n      <h3>Job Seeker</h3>\n      <table>\n        <tr>\n          <th>Needs</th>\n          <th>Design Feature</th>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"37%\">Find open positions that suit their interests and qualifications\n</td>\n          <td>Allow students to search and filter through jobs\n            <div>Provide a list of jobs, each with details and instructions to apply</div>\n          </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td>Connect with recruiters and employees at companies</td>\n          <td>Provide a prominent email address to contact for every posting\n</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td>Deal with rejection and loneliness throughout the process</td>\n          <td>Show articles written by other students about their experiences and advice</td>\n        </tr>\n      </table>\n\n      <h3>Stanford Daily</h3>\n      <table>\n        <tr>\n          <th>Needs</th>\n          <th>Design Feature</th>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"40%\">Earn extra money\n</td>\n          <td>Implement payment processing</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td>Attract views on the Stanford Daily website</td>\n          <td>Include links to articles in the Daily</td>\n        </tr>\n      </table>\n\n      <h2>User Flow</h2>\n      <p>Feeling pretty overwhelmed by the task in front of me, I outlined the most important paths users could take through the website.

I wanted the site to be associated with Stanford without coming across as academic and instructional, so I chose red and green as the main colors but brightened them to provide a friendlier tone and avoid reminding students of their looming pile of psets. I didn’t want the red to instill a sense of alarm or danger, so I calmed it to be more pink-like.</p>\n        <p>I chose the font Source Sans Pro for the body to make the job descriptions and titles seem less intimidating and more inviting.</p>\n      </div>\n\n      <h2>Developed Features</h2>\n      <p>After creating high-fidelity prototypes in Adobe XD, I developed Job Tree using React, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and PHP.</p>\n      <a href=\"https://thestanforddaily.github.io/jobs-board/#/\" target=\"_blank\" className=\"btn-big\">View Site</a>\n\n      <h3>Jobs List</h3>\n      <p>As the application process is time-consuming enough, I wanted to make it as fast as possible for the user to find the jobs they are interested in.

The business team will handle advertising, finding job opportunities, and more, and I’ve been working with them to ensure the product aligns with the Stanford Daily business.\n</p>\n\n      <h2>Reflection</h2>\n      <p>Before this project, I didn’t know how websites were made, and I hadn’t heard of visual hierarchy/React/Balsamiq. Designing and developing my first website has been an incredible learning experience, opening me up to the world of design and the technology that brings it to life. I learned how to empathize with users, develop wireframes and information architecture, use Git, and integrate myself with the design community.</p>\n    <p>If I returned to this project in the future, I would want to test the website on multiple users and iterate on the design using the results. As I grow my technical skills, I would love to be able to incorporate animation and storytelling into interface designs, create push notifications and email alerts from web content, and increase personalization by coding recommendation algorithms.\n</p>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default JobsBoard;\n","import React from 'react';\nimport ReactGA from 'react-ga';\nimport { Switch, HashRouter, Route } from \"react-router-dom\";\nimport ScrollToTop from 'react-router-scroll-top';\nimport './components/styles.css';\nimport NavBar from './components/NavBar';\nimport Leaflet from './components/Leaflet.jsx';\nimport WebMD from './components/WebMD.jsx';\nimport Journie from './components/Journie.jsx';\nimport Projects from './components/Projects';\nimport JobsBoard from './components/JobsBoard.jsx';\nimport handicon from './components/images/handicon.png';\nimport eyeicon from './components/images/eyeicon.png';\nimport youngme from './components/images/youngme.png';\n\nReactGA.initialize(\"UA-153162012-1\");\n\nclass App extends React.Component {\n  componentDidMount = () => ReactGA.pageview(window.location.pathname + window.location.search);\n  componentDidUpdate = () => ReactGA.pageview(window.location.pathname + window.location.search);\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <div className=\"main-container\">\n        <HashRouter basename=\"/portfolio\" >\n          <ScrollToTop>\n            <NavBar />\n            <Switch>\n              <Route exact path='/' component={Projects} />\n              <Route exact path='/journie' component={Journie} />\n              <Route exact path='/leaflet' component={Leaflet} />\n              <Route exact path='/webmd-gen-z' component={WebMD} />\n              <Route exact path='/daily-job-site' component={JobsBoard} />\n              <Route exact path='/about' component={About} />\n              <Route path='*' component={Projects} />\n            </Switch>\n            {/* <Footer /> */}\n          </ScrollToTop>\n        </HashRouter>\n      </div >\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default App;\n\nfunction About() {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"project\">\n      <img src={youngme} style={{ width: \"25%\", display: \"block\", borderRadius: \"0px\" }} className=\"profile-pic\"/>\n      <div className=\"about-text\">\n      <h1>\n        Hi, I’m Grace!\n      </h1>\n      <p>I’m a designer, creative technologist, and writer.
