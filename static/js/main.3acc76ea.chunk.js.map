Recently, the rise of competitors that target younger audiences has put a strain on the company’s traffic statistics.

We found that sites aimed at a young adult demographic like Healthline curate more wellness- and lifestyle-focused content and write with more relatable voices. They also emphasize diverse imagery, include LGBTQ health information, and exhibit young people’s medical stories more than WebMD. More established publishers such as MayoClinic and CNN Health had the advantage of high perceived credibility.</p>\n            </div>\n\n            <h2>User Research</h2>\n            <p>We conducted a 21-question survey on Gen Z’s health habits, how they receive health information, and their opinions of WebMD.

As a result, they may shy away from WebMD because they associate the site with illness, particularly cancer. </p>\n            <p>Gen Zers also expressed a desire for a redesigned homepage that is “cleaner,” “easier to navigate,” and has a “more dynamic, social-media-esque layout.”</p>\n            <p>The current WebMD homepage emphasizes medical conditions and appears cluttered to Gen Zers, which may discourage them from visiting the site more often.</p>\n\n            <h2>Solution: Creating a Landing Page for Gen Zers</h2>\n            <p>After brainstorming recommendations to attract Gen Zers to WebMD, we each took one to develop and present. I chose to work on fleshing out the concept of a landing page (also called health centers) on WebMD’s site aimed at the Gen Z demographic.\n</p>\n            <h3>Content Strategy</h3>\n            <p>Drawing on our survey results and my SEO knowledge, I created a possible strategy for the landing page’s content.\n</p>\n            <img src={contentoverview} />\n            <p>To provide a more specific picture of the page’s content, I came up with over 20 possible pitches. I also wanted each pitch to have high SEO potential, so I analyzed keyword volume, competition, and content gaps using Keywords Everywhere and seoClarity. </p>\n            <p>In terms of business, I learned that the Gen Z page could help diversify revenue streams. WebMD struggles to engage with consumer packaged goods advertising, but including more wellness content could get more views to attract these brands.\n</p>\n<h3>Design</h3>\n<p>After finding content Gen Z would enjoy, I helped design the interface it could be housed in. I studied sites popular with Gen Zers such as BuzzFeed and Huffington Post to see how they attract an audience. I noted that these sites prioritize relatable article content and had easy-to-understand categories such as “Trending Now.”\n</p>\n<p>For the site’s design, I chose the colors yellow, blue, and pink so it could have broad appeal while seeming youthful and positive. I brainstormed and wrote headlines that address the topics Gen Z is most interested in, incorporating words like “you” where appropriate. Because Gen Z is the most diverse generation, I found images that reflected that. I sent all of this content to the designer, communicating that I wanted the mockup to emphasize article content and have clear categories.\n</p>\n<p>Here was the final mockup (for comparison, the current Teen Health Center is on the left).</p>\n<div className=\"mockup\">\n<img className=\"left\" src={teencenter} />\n<img src={genzcenter} />\n</div>\n            <h2>What I Learned</h2>\n            <p>For the majority of the project, I actually didn’t know much about “UI/UX” (if you mentioned affinity maps to me, I probably would’ve just pictured two globes kissing).

ROMANCE/HORNY TEENS. TIGER PARENTS. It’s the high school coming-of-age story that no one has dared to put on screen (for good reason). Instead of football, there’s math team. Instead of mean girls, there are judgmental genius teens horny for the Ivy Leagues. Instead of bullying, there’s racism against Asians. Instead of insane parties with alcohol, there are nights of studying that are equally long and exhausting. A major motivation of mine was to depict a version of high school/teendom that is far more realistic to me but I haven’t seen much in today’s popular culture. I explore the insanely stressful culture high school can cultivate, the role social media (particularly Instagram) plays in teenagers’ lives, and what coming-of-age can look like for Asian-Americans. Also, I look for the humor in these situations.\n                </p>\n                <p>I brainstormed, outlined, and wrote a full-length script from June through August 2018 as part of the Screenwriters Network’s first screenplay competition.\n                </p>\n                <div className=\"quote\">Logline: Lena Yang struggles to become extraordinary in her junior year of high school after realizing she’s fallen behind her peers and that her parents are disappointed in her.</div>\n\n                <h2>Researching, Learning, Watching</h2>\n                <p>Before the contest officially began, I learned how to structure and write screenplays by reading books like <i>Screenwriter’s Bible</i> and <i>Save the Cat</i>. I knew I wanted to write a comedy about an Asian-American girl surviving high school, so I also re-watched and read the screenplays of <i>Eighth Grade</i>, <i>Mean Girls</i>, and <i>Bridesmaids</i>.

What do they want at the beginning of the story? What needs of theirs are fulfilled in the end? After writing their biographies, I then brainstormed possible scenes and ordered them into a detailed outline of the three acts. </p>\n            </div>\n\n            <h2>Writing, Procrastinating, and More Writing</h2>\n            <p>Because contest participants were given deadlines every Friday and I was doing an internship during the week, I frequently stayed up until 3AM pumping out lines of dialogue. Teen characters’ lines flowed right out of me, but I often found myself halting and sputtering when trying to write what a teacher or parent would say. I also worked hard to balance the comedy with serious moments, include authentic details about Chinese culture, and make the characters’ actions consistent with the biographies I established. After completing the first draft, I had enough time to re-write the entire third act before I needed to submit my screenplay.</p>\n            <h2>Result</h2>\n            <p>The contest started with 123 writers; 21 finished. My screenplay was voted by Screenwriters Network members to end up in the top 10 (what?!). Two people messaged me their suggestions and notes for my screenplay, which was incredibly generous of them. The best surprise, however, was finding this message in my inbox months after the contest had ended:</p>\n            <img src={discordcomment} />\n            <p>I didn’t expect anyone to take the time to read my screenplay all the way through, so I was shocked that someone had good things to say about it. </p>\n\n            <h2>Takeaways</h2>\n            <p>Experiencing the screenwriting process has changed the way I look at movies -- and people -- forever. I’ve internalized the three-act story structure and become familiar with the kinds of twists that can occur. I’ve learned how to better understand people’s desires and frustrations as well as how these drive them to certain actions. And I’ve gotten better at tackling large creative tasks in a relatively short amount of time.</p>\n            <img src={whizkid3} />\n        </div>\n    );\n}\n\nexport default WebMD;\n","import React from 'react';\nimport './styles.css';\nimport landingpage from './images/jobslandingpage@2x.png'\n\nfunction JobsBoard() {\n    return (\n        <div className=\"project\">\n            <h1 className=\"projTitle\">Job Tree</h1>\n            <p className=\"subtitle\">Designing and developing a more personalized jobs search experience for Stanford students (and my first website ever).</p>\n            \n            <div className=\"row\">\n                <div className=\"column\">\n                    <h4>Duration:</h4><p>In progress</p>\n                </div>\n                <div className=\"column\">\n                    <h4>Teammates:</h4><p>Just me</p>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            <p>Full case study coming soon!

The harp weeping as a character dies, the violins swelling during a kiss. But in movies, sound can be constrained to a flat screen. VR headsets like the Oculus Go, on the other hand, offer powerful spatial audio in addition to 360 visuals. When it came time to create a project in my class CS11: Intro to VR Design & Development, I wondered how I could make a VR experience with sound at its core.\n\n            <h2>The Idea</h2>\n            <p>I decided to create a game where players listen and try to pinpoint where audio cues are coming from. As children, we all learn the sounds animals make; it’s almost as important to our education as learning to tie our shoes. So my game was set on a farm. At the beginning of the game, players stand in the middle of a farm and hear sounds created by multiple sources. When they point and click a source, its sound stops: silence is golden.</p>\n\n            <h2>Creation Process</h2>\n            <p>To create the farm scene, I arranged several assets I found online and set up the lighting and camera positions. I connected the assets to sound clips, and configured them in Unity so that triggering the source would silence its sound.</p>\n\n            <h2>Outcome</h2>\n            <p>During my class’s demo day, several people tried out my game. I learned that the instructions were easy to miss, so in the future, I should try creating a separate screen with the instructions placed directly in front of players' eyes. People seemed to enjoy clicking the sounds away once they learned how the game worked.</p>\n            </p>\n        </div>\n    );\n}\n\nexport default JobsBoard;\n","import React from 'react';\nimport { Switch, BrowserRouter as Router, Route } from \"react-router-dom\";\nimport './index.css';\nimport NavBar from './components/NavBar';\nimport Writing from './components/Writing';\nimport Projects from './components/Projects';\nimport WebMD from './components/WebMD.jsx';\nimport WhizKid from './components/WhizKid.jsx';\nimport JobsBoard from './components/JobsBoard.jsx';\nimport SoundOff from './components/SoundOff';\n\nclass App extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <div>\n        <Router>\n          <NavBar />\n            <Switch>\n              <Route exact path='/' component={Projects} />\n              <Route exact path='/webmd-gen-z' component={WebMD} />\n              <Route exact path='/daily-job-site' component={JobsBoard} />\n              <Route exact path='/whiz-kid' component={WhizKid} />\n              <Route exact path='/sound-off' component={SoundOff} />\n              <Route exact path='/about' component={About} />\n              <Route exact path='/writing' component={Writing} />\n              <Route path='*' component={Projects} />\n            </Switch>\n          <Footer />\n        </Router>\n      </div >\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default App;\n\nfunction About() {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"about\">\n      As a kid, I would fold paper and draw buttons on them to create my dream computers.
