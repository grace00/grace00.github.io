While transcription software exists, it only aids one of many steps in a journalist’s interview and writing process.</p>\n\n      <h2>Solution</h2>\n      <p>In CS 206: Exploring Computational Journalism, I and two teammates built Leaflet, a web platform that <b>bridges audio, transcripts, and notes in meaningful ways to optimize the journalist’s workflow</b>. Leaflet allows journalists to receive automated transcripts of their recordings, research related news, link their handwritten notes to their transcriptions, save quotes for later, and begin crafting their stories.\n</p>\n      <h2>My Contribution</h2>\n      <ul>\n        <li>In the research phase, I <b>conducted competitive analysis, interviews, and created a journey map</b> to synthesize our findings.\n</li>\n        <li>I made paper sketches and <b>created a prototype in Figma</b> that was later developed for the final interface.\n</li>\n        <li>I researched and selected the computer vision and speech-to-text APIs used in the final product.\n</li>\n        <li>I <b>programmed the frontend and backend of nearly every feature</b>, including automated speech-to-text transcription, audio playback tools, handwritten-to-digital notes conversion with computer vision, the quote bank, and related news search features.\n</li>\n        <li>I <b>conducted all the usability testing sessions</b> and incorporated the feedback into the final developed product.</li>\n      </ul>\n\n      <div className=\"full-width section-container gray\">\n        <div className=\"project\">\n          <h2>Demo</h2>\n          <video width=\"100%\" controls>\n            <source src={demo} type=\"video/mp4\" />\n        Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n</video>\n          <div className=\"small-text\">Note: Leaflet has already transcribed the reporter's audio file and converted a picture of their notes into digitized text using computer vision.</div>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n      <h2>Research</h2>\n      <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>\n      <p>Before creating the application, we studied five popular transcription tools. We input real audio from interviews to gauge their accuracy and available features.\n</p>\n      <img src={Competitors} />\n      <p>Nearly every tool provided a correction interface for the transcript, identified different speakers, and showed timestamps. However, <b> none had features that specifically targeted the reporting process – the tools’ capabilities were general in order to please wider audiences</b>. As a result, they didn’t help users with much beyond transcribing audio, which is often just one step of a user’s workflow.</p>\n\n      <h3>Interviews</h3>\n      <p>We spoke to local reporters at The Stanford Daily and industry reporters to gain greater understanding of their workflow and how transcription fits into it.\n</p>\n      <p>We gained these insights:</p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>Before doing an interview or attending an event, reporters <b>conduct research</b> to gain context about their subject.</li>\n        <li>While recording audio at these events, they <b>limit the presence of electronic devices</b> to avoid distracting others.\n</li>\n        <li>Journalists usually <b>take handwritten notes</b> when interviewing to make note of important points, and they often include timestamps.\n</li>\n        <li>Student journalists <b>record audio during interviews</b> and <b>transcribe it later with automated transcription software</b></li>\n        <li>Journalists <b>use their notes to locate key sections</b> of the interview/transcript to incorporate into their story.\n</li>\n        <li>Many journalists store quotes from transcripts in their own makeshift \"<b>quote banks</b>,” which they draw on when writing.\n</li>\n      </ul>\n      <p>Our results and technical abilities led us to focus on creating an <b>unintrusive web transcription tool that helps journalists identify important information in their audio to use in their stories</b>.</p>\n\n      <h3>Journey Mapping</h3>\n      <p>With the insights from our research, I mapped out a reporter’s typical writing process to identify opportunities for our tool to help.</p>\n      <img src={JourneyMap} className=\"shadow\" />\n\n      <h2>Design</h2>\n      <h3>Ideation</h3>\n      <p>After learning about journalists’ transcription needs and processes, we brainstormed and discussed ideas for features that would be useful for a reporter before, during, and after transcribing. Beyond the main functionality of transcribing audio, we decided to focus on these features:\n</p>\n      <ul>\n        <li><b>Quote bank</b> for saving and storing notable quotes </li>\n        <li><b>News search</b> for finding related published stories </li>\n        <li><b>Correctional interface</b> for editing the automated transcript</li>\n        <li><b>Conversion of handwritten notes to digitized text</b> that links back to the transcript using computer vision</li>\n      </ul>\n      <p>We considered many other ideas but ultimately chose these to fit within time and technical constraints.</p>\n\n      <h3>User Feedback</h3>\n      <p>We conducted a survey to learn more about journalists’ processes and what they thought of our ideas. From the respondents, we learned that:</p>\n      <div className=\"box-container\">\n        <div className=\"box\"><div>Transcription is the most time-consuming part of their writing process.</div></div>\n        <div className=\"box\"><div>Most of them currently use automated transcription software.</div></div>\n        <div className=\"box\"><div>All of them replay parts of their audio to collect exact quotes for their stories.</div></div>\n        <div className=\"box\"><div>They take notes during interviews and would use a digital note-taking feature.</div></div>\n        <div className=\"box\"><div>All reported that a quote bank would be useful and that they would use it.</div></div>\n      </div>\n\n      <h3>Prototypes</h3>\n      <p>I created sketches and prototypes for our team to get an idea of the application’s visual structure and technical requirements.</p>\n      <div className=\"large-overflow\">\n        <div className=\"image-row\">\n          <img src={Sketch} className=\"shadow\" />\n          {/*<img src={LowFi} className=\"shadow\" />*/}\n          <img src={HiFi} className=\"shadow\" />\n        </div>\n      </div>\n\n      <h3>Usability Testing</h3>\n      <p>After beginning development, I conducted usability testing with journalists. I asked them to complete a series of tasks while expressing their thoughts out loud as well as questions about their experiences with transcribing audio.\n</p>\n      <img src={Test1} className=\"shadow\" />\n      <div className=\"small-text\">Interface presented to users in the first round of testing</div>\n      <img src={Test2} className=\"shadow\" />\n      <div className=\"small-text\">Interface presented to users in the second round of testing</div>\n\n      <p>I found that:</p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>Users <b>liked the quote bank</b> and had no trouble using it.</li>\n        <li>To search for related news, they always used the search box instead of the “Search Highlighted Words” button.</li>\n        <li>A technical bug caused the quotes in the quote bank to be wiped out whenever the user switched to a different tab.</li>\n        <li>They <b>expressed desire to save or pin the news articles</b> they found for later.</li>\n      </ul>\n      <p>As a result of these findings, I made changes to the design and code.</p>\n\n\n      <div className=\"full-width section-container gray\">\n        <div className=\"project\">\n          <h2>Development</h2>\n\n          <h3>Choosing the Foundations</h3>\n          <p>Leaflet was made with a <b>React frontend and Python backend</b>. We also drew upon <b>Flask, Semantic UI, Microsoft Computer Vision, Google Speech-to-Text, and News API</b>.</p>\n          <p>We used React for the foundation of the interface and Semantic UI for basic visual components such as buttons, icons, and input. Due to time constraints, we were unable to change the default font, font sizes, and a few other aesthetic elements to be exactly like our planned design, but Semantic UI did heavily streamline our frontend development.\n</p>\n\n          <h3>Programming the Functionalities</h3>\n          <p>That left a daunting task ahead of me: programming and manipulating the backend to curate the content we wanted to display. <b>Computer vision for converting images of handwritten notes into digitized text was the first feature I implemented</b>. After testing and researching different computer vision APIs that could recognize written characters, I chose Microsoft’s for its low cost and relatively high accuracy. I created a Python script to communicate with the API and used Flask to pass in images users uploaded to the interface. </p>\n          <p>To implement automated transcription, I followed a similar process. I selected Google’s Speech-to-Text for video API as it seemed to be the most accurate free service. Additionally, it provided useful features like speaker separation. With the data sent from the API, I was able to <b>implement specialized audio features to help users navigate the transcript and audio</b>. These included transcript-audio word matching (click on a word in the transcript and the corresponding audio plays), live highlighting (the word being played gets highlighted), visual separation of speakers, and more.</p>\n          <img src={Code} />\n          <a href=\"https://github.com/chloebarreau/leafletnotebook/commits/master\" target=\"_blank\" className=\"btn-big\">View GitHub</a>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n      <h2>Final Product</h2>\n      <p>After weeks of furious developing, we created the final version of Leaflet: a modern transcription application designed to help journalists at every stage of their writing process.</p>\n      <img src={LeafletFinal} className=\"shadow\" />\n\n      <h3>Transcription</h3>\n      <p>Journalists can upload an audio file and receive an automated transcript quickly.</p>\n      <img src={Transcription} className=\"shadow\" />\n\n      <h3>Playback Tools</h3>\n      <p>Journalists can easily verify quotes by clicking on a word, which will play the audio from that word.

I designed 9 error states for different use cases. \n</p>\n<p>\nWhile doing so, I came across a custom component that was being used to fill a gap in the design system, but it didn’t meet accessibility standards. I revised it to meet them and be more visually aligned with existing system components. I <b>proposed this as a new component for the system</b> so it could be easily incorporated into other parts of the app, improving consistency.\n</p>\n\n\n<div className=\"full-width section-container gray\">\n        <div className=\"project\">\n<h5>TAKEAWAYS</h5>\n      <h3>Lessons learned\n      </h3>\n\n      <ol>\n            <li>\n              <b>Making decisions without user testing</b>\n              <p>My team didn’t do user testing because of limited UX research bandwidth. Instead, I was expected to draw from existing research and my design intuition to form POVs on the design.

I learned what avenues (1:1s, chats, or group posts) were appropriate under which circumstances, how to quickly provide necessary context, and when to use feedback or set it aside.  \n</p>\n            </li>\n            <li>\n              <b>Keeping partners informed\n</b>\n              <p>My partners were focusing on other projects at the same time, so it was my job to keep them updated on my progress and where I needed their help.

when she comes to this page, she’s specifically <b>looking for tech-related events</b>, but there’s <b>no way to filter down to them</b>, and the filters that are provided aren’t helpful. She has to scroll through the all of the listings as a result, which is time-consuming. \n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n      While <b>Handshake collects information about the user’s job preferences elsewhere</b> (like what industries they’re interested in and what kind of opportunities they’re looking for), <b>this page doesn’t take any of that into account</b>. The <b>events are the same</b> no matter if you’re a freshman looking for your first internship or a PhD student trying to learn about research opportunities. \n\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        Some <b>events have a waitlist or are not available</b> to the student because they don’t meet the qualifications. This <b>information isn’t communicated to the user</b> until after they click on an event. This error could be easily prevented by surfacing this information on the listings page.\n\n        </p>\n      <h2>With these insights, I identified 3 objectives for the redesign:</h2>\n      <ol>\n        <li>\n        Speed up the process of finding relevant career events\n        </li>\n        <li>\n        Make the resulting events easier to scan \n          </li>\n          <li>\n          Clearly convey which events are not available to the user\n          </li>\n        </ol>{/* <h5>BLUEPRINT</h5>\n      <h3>Mapping the service</h3>\n      <p>\n        The app would be part of a larger service that involves the customer, the product, and the employees.

The <b>vertical listing of events may also help scanning</b> because the user’s eye can move down to read the titles rather than in a zig-zag motion like variation 1.\n</p>\n<img src={Var2} className=\"shadow\"/>\n<br />\n<h4>Variation 3</h4>\n          <p>In the current Events page, it takes an extra click to view what events you’ve registered are.

He also liked that it was less cluttered than the other variations.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n          Regina <b>preferred Variation 2</b> because it would allow her to adjust the filters and <b>see the results update in real time.</b> She also remarked that text can be too much to parse sometimes, so the pictures make the experience more pleasant.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n          I decided to <b>move forward with Variation 2 while also incorporating the Recommendations section Andrew liked</b> into it. I thought the slight increase clutter would be worth the benefits Regina mentioned of seeing the results of the filtering in real time. Also, the left filter sidebar is a common design pattern (found on Amazon and other parts of Handshake), so I made the assumption that users would be fine with it.\n          </p>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n\n      <h5>SOLUTION</h5>\n      <h3>Find relevant events</h3>\n      <p>In the redesign, students can <b>find relevant career events</b> more easily through <b>improved filters,

For example, I learned that it’s possible to automatically add a link to a user’s post underneath their profile. Currently, users have to do this manually by pasting the post’s link into their user profile, which—unsurprisingly—very few people do. The redesign uses the automated method to reduce users’ work and ensure that their pages get linked. This new way excited both stakeholders and users.\n            </p>\n              </div>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"icon-box\">\n              <div class=\"icon\"><FontAwesomeIcon icon={faEdit} /></div>\n              <div>\n                <h1>Revise forms carefully</h1>\n                <p>\n                  As I was revising the forms, I searched meticulously for form fields that were unnecessary. Taking them out would streamline the form and save users’ time. I learned early on that I needed to collaborate with the director to avoid taking out any form fields that provided information she needed to have. For example, there were a few questions in the Create Account form that I suggested removing until the director explained they were there to help her tell which account requests were legitimate.\n</p>\n              </div>\n            </div>\n            {/* <div className=\"icon-box\">\n              <span class=\"icon\"><FontAwesomeIcon icon={faUser} /></span>\n              <div>\n                <h1>Balance stakeholder and user needs</h1>\n                <p>\n                  I needed to work on balancing stakeholders’ and users’ needs a lot with this project.
